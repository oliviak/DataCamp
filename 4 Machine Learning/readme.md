# Machine Learning in Azure

Here you will learn the following:
- pre-processing in Machine Learning Studio (in short: ML Studio),
- read data from an Azure SQL DB in ML Studio,
- build models in ML Studio (binary classification),
- deploy a trained model as a web service in ML Studio (binary classification),
- do market basket analysis in RStudio,
- execute an R script in ML Studio,
- deploy an R script as a web service in the ML Studio
- use the MatchBox Recommender in the ML Studio.
